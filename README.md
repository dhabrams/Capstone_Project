# Capstone_Project
Data Incubator Capstone Project

This code for this project is contained within the 2 Jupyter Noteboks, Classifier_cuisine and recipes_clustering. The data is contained in ingredients5.csv, recipe3.csv and train.json.

The main purpose of this project is to analyze recipes and, through machine learning, identify which recipes are similar to each other using their ingredients as features. There are many potential business applications. One app would be a recipe recommendation engine where a user selects a favorite recipe and receives recommendations for similar recipes. Another application, could be used to for sales to identify new products that are similar to popular items that have higher profit margins. Another application would be to recommend recipes for individulas with dietary restrictions.
